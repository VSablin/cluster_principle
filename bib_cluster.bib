abstract = "Available for the first time in paperback, The Quantum Theory of Fields is a self-contained, comprehensive, and up-to-date introduction to quantum field theory from Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg. Volume I introduces the foundations of quantum field theory. The development is fresh and logical throughout, with each step carefully motivated by what has gone before. After a brief historical outline, the book begins with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow. Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence. The classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics are presented in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. It contains much original material, and is peppered with examples and insights drawn from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle research. Exercises are included at the end of each chapter.",

  abstract={The weak nonlinear Kerr interaction between single photons and intense laser fields has been recently proposed as a basis for distributed optics-based solutions to few-qubit applications in quantum communication and computation. Here, we analyse the above Kerr interaction by employing a continuous-time multi-mode model for the input/output fields to/from the nonlinear medium. In contrast to previous single-mode treatments of this problem, our analysis takes into account the full temporal content of the free-field input beams as well as the non-instantaneous response of the medium. The main implication of this model, in which the cross-Kerr phase shift on one input is proportional to the photon flux of the other input, is the existence of phase noise terms at the output. We show that these phase noise terms will preclude satisfactory performance of the parity gate proposed by Munro et al (2005 New J. Phys. 7 137).}

abstract = {The propagation of N photons in one dimensional waveguides coupled to M qubits is discussed, both in the strong and ultrastrong qubit-waveguide coupling. Special emphasis is placed on the characterisation of the nonlinear response and its linear limit for the scattered photons as a function of N, M, qubit inter distance and light-matter coupling. The quantum evolution is numerically solved via the matrix product states technique. The time evolutions for both the field and qubits are computed. The nonlinear character (as a function of N/M) depends on the computed observable. While perfect reflection is obtained for N/M≅1, photon-photon correlations are still resolved for ratios N/M=non-zero. Inter-qubit distance enhances the nonlinear response. Moving to the ultrastrong coupling regime, we observe that inelastic processes are robust against the number of qubits and that the qubit-qubit interaction mediated by the photons is qualitatively modified. The theory developed in this work models experiments in circuit QED, photonic crystals and dielectric waveguides.},

The bound on the entropy grows surprisingly rapidly with the correlation length; we discuss this in terms of properties of quantum expanders and present a conjecture on matrix product states which may provide an alternate way of arriving at an area law. We also show that, for gapped, local systems, the bound on Von Neumann entropy implies a bound on R{\'{e}}nyi entropy for sufficiently large $\alpha${\textless}1 and implies the ability to approximate the ground state by a matrix product state.},

With quality factor up to 45 000, mode volume smaller than a cubic optical wavelength in material, and electric field maximum located in the high-refractive index region at the cavity center, this design can enable both strong coupling and lasing with a single quantum dot exciton. The achievable range of the quality factor to mode volume ratios and the feasible fabrication of the proposed structure make it favorable to other semiconductor microcavities.},

abstract = {Tailoring the interactions between quantum emitters and single photons constitutes one of the cornerstones of quantum optics. Coupling a quantum emitter to the band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) provides a unique platform for tuning these interactions. In particular, the cross-over from propagating fields [Formula: see text] outside the bandgap to localized fields [Formula: see text] within the bandgap should be accompanied by a transition from largely dissipative atom-atom interactions to a regime where dispersive atom-atom interactions are dominant. Here, we experimentally observe this transition by shifting the band edge frequency of the PCW relative to the [Formula: see text] line of atomic cesium for [Formula: see text] atoms trapped along the PCW. Our results are the initial demonstration of this paradigm for coherent atom-atom interactions with low dissipation into the guided mode.},
